General description: <br/>
For my first experience with Android I have a tic tac toe game made against the computer (AI). During the 
making of this game i got acquainted with how i can create different activities, how you can create buttons, how to play 
sound, how you can appeal to the sensors (eg recognize shaking ), how to create a menu, how to set preference, etc.
